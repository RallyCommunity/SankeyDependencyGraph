SankeyDependencyChart
=========================

## Overview
Based on the Sankey D3 Visualization, this app looks at all dependencies within a Rally Project and graphs the flow of Dependencies.

This app will use the Lookback API (LBAPI) when available and fallback to the standard Webservices API otherwise. WSAPI can be slower to use depending on the number of dependencies in the project.
